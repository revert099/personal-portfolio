## The problem
Manual run sheets took time and introduced errors.

## What I built
- Reads routing exports
- Cleans and formats data
- Writes into a pre-made template without breaking conditional formatting

## Highlights
- Robust sorting rules for combined pack days
- Template-first approach to preserve formatting
- Modular pipeline for maintainability

## Next steps
- Add validation reports
- Add a small UI to select inputs
