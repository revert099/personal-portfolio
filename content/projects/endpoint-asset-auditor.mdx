## Overview
I’m building an **Endpoint Asset Auditor** — a cross-platform auditing tool designed for cybersecurity consulting work. The program will run offline (i.e. no internet access required) from a USB drive, and generate a client-ready report that captures:

- system + hardware inventory  
- network posture snapshots (routes, DNS, proxies, exposure)
- evidence for each check (raw command outputs where relevant)
- an easy to read resilience score from 1-100 *(in progress)*

## Project Structure
The repository is split into portable **shared collectors** and platform **OS-specific collectors**.

### `shared/` (cross-platform)
- `hardware.py` — CPU, memory, disk, battery (where available)
- `network.py` — interface inventory + (best-effort) listening ports
- `system.py` — baseline system identity (in progress)
- `security.py` — shared security signals (in progress)

### `collectors/` (platform-specific)
- `mac/mac_network.py` — macOS route/DNS/proxy using native tooling (`route`, `scutil`)
- `linux/linux_network.py` — Linux route/DNS/proxy using best-effort fallbacks (`ip`, `resolvectl`, `/etc/resolv.conf`)
- `mac.py`, `linux.py`, `windows.py` — platform entry points / orchestration (in progress)

### Core + reporting
- `core/models.py` — dataclasses / result schema (evolving)
- `core/report.py` — report assembly + JSON writing (in progress)
- `reports/formatter.py` — output formatting utilities (in progress)
- `helpers/unix.py` — shared command helpers (e.g. `run_cmd`) for Unix-like platforms

### Outputs
- `results/audit_report.json` — example output generated during development

## What I’ve Built So Far
### 1) Shared inventory (via `psutil`)
Details found at **https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/**
- CPU core counts + frequencies + utilisation
- memory (virtual + swap)
- disk partitions + disk usage per mount
- interface inventory (IPv4/IPv6/MAC + link stats)
- listening ports snapshot

### 2) macOS network posture
Implemented macOS-specific functions that capture evidence and return consistent JSON:
- default route / gateway (`route -n get default`)
- DNS resolver configuration (`scutil --dns`)
- proxy configuration (`scutil --proxy`)

### 3) Linux network posture
Linux equivalents with fallbacks for distro variance:
- default route (`ip route show default`, fallback to `route -n` / `netstat -rn`)
- DNS (`resolvectl status`, fallback to `/etc/resolv.conf`)
- proxy (environment variables + optional `/etc/environment`)

### 4) Windows network posture
Using PowerShell + netsh. Windows equivalents:
- default route (`Get-NetRoute` + interface mapping; fallback to `route print`)
- DNS (`Get-DnsClientServerAddress`; fallback to `ipconfig /all`)
- proxy (`netsh winhttp show proxy` + HKCU Internet Settings)

## Why These Checks Matter
I prioritised controls that are easily explainable to clients and non-technical users:

- **Default gateway + interface** → validates expected egress path (LAN vs VPN/tunnel)
- **DNS resolvers** → detects rogue/unexpected DNS configuration
- **Proxy config** → highlights interception points or compliance gaps
- **Listening ports** → quick exposure snapshot (best-effort; permissions vary)

Every platform-specific function captures **evidence** (command + rc + stdout/stderr) so audit results can be justified.

## What’s Next
### MVP completion
- Standardise all collector outputs into a single result schema (`core/models.py`)
- Finish the report builder (`core/report.py`) so scoring + findings are consistent
- Add CSV output for client-friendly summaries

### Security expansion (after network)
- macOS: FileVault, Gatekeeper, SIP, firewall rules posture (as policy allows)
- Windows: Defender status, Firewall profiles, BitLocker
- Linux: firewall posture, SSH hardening indicators, encryption indicators

### Packaging
- “Run from USB” workflow:
  - bootstrap venv OR package to an executable (PyInstaller)
  - predictable output directory (`results/`)
  - minimal dependencies and safe failure modes

## Example Output
Right now, outputs are generated as JSON into `results/audit_report.json`.  
As the schema stabilises, I’ll add:
- a short “executive summary” section
- a scoring breakdown by category (hardware / network / security)
- clear remediation hints per finding
