## Introduction
With Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) facing increasing pressure to use, adopt and
integrate technological-based solutions, the challenges associated with maintaining
secure operations are becoming increasingly complex. In the modern age, SMEs are
dependent on digital platforms to streamline operations, assist customers, receive
feedback, and ultimately promote business growth. Although this digital transformation
has a huge range of benefits, there comes an increased exposure to cyber threats and
vulnerabilities, and SMEs are not looking towards information security (IS) management
to supplement the dependency [1]. With businesses storing confidential customer,
client, and operational data, it is essential for SMEs to prioritise IS management to
reduce the risks associated with cybercrime.

A SME is defined by the number of employees in a business. For this essay, the
Australian Cyber Security Centre’s (ACSC) definition of a SME has been considered,
which is a business ranging from 1 to 199 employee(s) [2]. Despite their stature, SMEs
play a key role in economic development, occupying 98% of businesses in Australia [3]
and 90% globally [4]. Small businesses have been reluctant to implement Cyber
Security measures with security often an afterthought. Unfortunately, most business
owners do not fully understand the risks associated with an attack [5]. Furthermore,
they do not believe that they would be targeted, assuming that it is only a problem for
larger organisations.

Many SMEs do not have the overhead to recover from a disaster, with over half who have
experienced an attack going out of business within 6 months [6]. With many businesses
still recovering financially from the COVID-19 pandemic [7], cybercrime poses a serious
threat to the longevity of SMEs and the economy worldwide. Additionally, the COVID-19
pandemic has impacted the workplace paradigm with a shift to more home-oriented
initiatives [8], further increasing the cyber threat landscape.

This case study's intended use is to provide an overview of IS management, raise
awareness for the necessary implementation of IS management for SMEs, strategies for
implementing Security Education Training and Awareness (SETA) programs, and the
issues associated with governance of IS management in SMEs.

## Overview of Information Security Management
Information Security is defined as “a set of security procedures and tools that broadly
protect sensitive enterprise information from misuse, unauthorized access, disruption,
or destruction” [9]. It provides a framework for effective IS management by maintaining
the three pillars of the CIA triad: confidentiality, integrity and availability of information
data and a business’s digital assets.

Until recently, information security was more narrowly focused on upholding the CIA
triad within the technological aspects of a business. The management of IS has now
broadened to an all-encompassing procedure, capturing physical, digital, application,
and environmental security, access control procedures, incidence response, disaster
recovery cybersecurity, and vulnerability management [9].

## Risks Associated with poor Information Security Management
Almost half of SMEs (48%) only allocate $500 annually to cybersecurity [2], due to
business owners not prioritising IS, as well as resource constraints limiting the ability to
successfully implement IS management. It has been reported that SMEs feel the risk
associated with cybercrime is low compared to larger organisations [10], with business
owners under the assumption that size and turnover are the driving factors for
cybercrime [11]. This assumption develops a distorted view of how secure their
businesses are.

Research has shown that SMEs face the same risks as larger organisations but lack
resources and departmental support to address them effectively [5]. Criminals are now
looking towards attacking SMEs opposed to larger organisations, considering them
easier to target due to lack of security initiatives, with Accenture’s Cost of Cybercrime
Study reporting that 43% of all cyberattacks are aimed at small businesses alone [12].
SMEs are often digitally interconnected to larger organisations and are utilised as a
backdoor for attackers to pivot to a more lucrative target [10]. SMEs cannot afford
constant monitoring to detect more subtle attacks, such as malware, exfiltrating data
[6] in comparison to larger organisations with sufficient budgets, dedicated
departments, and skilled staff to monitor a network. The decision to outsource
Information Security in SMEs is dependent on annual turnover [2] and a lack of
resources has been the biggest roadblock to implementation [13].

In Australia, 42% of small businesses believed that limiting their online presence
safeguarded their business from the risks associated with cybercrime [6]. Not only is
this practice unsustainable as it limits the growth potential of a business, unfortunately,
it is untrue, as any business using email communications in their operations is
threatened by phishing, social engineering, and malware attacks [14].

Between 2022 and 2023, the average cost associated with cyberattacks rose by 14%, as
well as the frequency of attacks by 23% [19]. SMEs are increasingly facing threats from
external actors targeting owners who choose to leave themselves vulnerable by not
prioritising IS management within their business.

## Justification for Implementation of IS in SMEs
Research has shown that small businesses struggle to financially recover from a
disaster due to the proportionate impact of cybercrime [6]. Australia’s Cyber Security
Centre (ACSC) reported that the average cost per cybercrime in FY21-22 for small
businesses was $49,000, and $88,000 for medium [12], an increase of 14% from FY20-
21. With 62% of Australian SMEs having experienced some form of cyber incident [2],
sound implementation of IS management is critical to the longevity and success of a
business.

Wilson et al. proposed that the actions of cyber criminals are indiscriminate [11].
Therefore, contrary to business owners’ beliefs [5], the chance of experiencing
cybercrime is substantial, with an ACSC’s Small Business Survey reporting that 62% of
small businesses had been affected by a breach [6] at some point. Implementing IS
management in SMEs protects confidential data from unauthorised access and theft
[16] mitigating the risks associated with data breaches, such as financial loss,
reputational damage, and the unauthorised disclosure of market secrets and
intellectual property.

From an ethical standpoint, SMEs are responsible for maintaining the privacy of their
client’s data [1], especially businesses that store contact information, identity
information or financial information [19]. Implementation of IS management has been
shown to increase customer retention through a commitment to corporate social
responsibility [17]. Perera et al. explain that customers consider the security of their
data in high regard, with security breaches being the most significant factor affecting an
organisation's reputation in their respective market [18].

With cyber criminals looking to target SMEs associated with larger organisations, such
organisations are taking into consideration SMEs IS initiatives to ensure that sufficient
implementations are in place [17]. With that said, implementing sound IS management
will provide a SME with a competitive advantage over other businesses that choose to
neglect their security [18].

## Information Security Challenges faced by SMEs
The human element is the most concerning for IS management. Researchers at
Stanford, partnered with a leading cybersecurity firm, found that approximately 88% of
IS breaches are caused by human error [20]. Hackers are capitalising on the negligence
of human’s digital behaviour, putting their focus into targeting them as opposed to
computer systems to infiltrate a business [27].

The Australian government defines the biggest threats to SMEs as scam messages,
email attacks and malware [25]. Encompassed with social engineering, these threats
are perpetrated at the human level within an organisation [27]. Training has been shown
to mitigate the risks linked to human behaviours, however, with one in five SMEs not
knowing the term ‘phishing’ [2] and Wilson et al. reporting 45% of SMEs had never
implemented any form of cyber security training [11], many SMEs lack any Security
Education Training and Awareness (SETA) policies to bolster their cyber resilience.

## Security Education Training and Awareness (SETA)
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines SETA as the
“awareness programs which set the stage for training by changing organisational
attitudes to realise the importance of security and the adverse consequences of its
failure” [20]. The primary functions of a successful SETA program include increasing an
employee’s knowledge of IS threats, clarification of existing countermeasures,
determination of policy violations within the business and improving the awareness of
roles and responsibilities pertinent to protecting information assets [21].

The major constraints SMEs face when considering the implementation of SETA
programs are a limited understanding of cybersecurity and its practises, and the
importance of human factors such as training and compliance [11]. A survey by Alyami
et al. found that the most important implementations of SETA critical success factors
included raising cyber awareness and knowledge thereby increasing employee maturity
and resilience, evaluate employee digital awareness at a frequency that fits a business’s
budget and structure and empowering upper management to encourage and support
employees to influence IS policy compliance [21].

Research shows that SMEs have difficulty finding a SETA program that is in line with a
business’s goals and objectives [13]. A reason for this is a lack of dynamic policy with
many SETA programs being directed at larger organisations, by providing one-size-fits-all
approaches. In fact, when implementing an effective SETA program, one factor for
success is SMEs should avoid implementing a one-size-fits-all solution [21]. These
solutions may not be fit for purpose for SMEs as there is an increased complexity in
implementation. These programs are targeted at larger businesses that have greater
outreaching scope and attack surface. Currently, there appears to be no research
applied to developing a framework to better suit SMEs [22] therefore business owners
need to focus on multiple frameworks, choosing what best suits the organisation's
goals and objectives.

SETA programs have been known to fail in the long term in SMEs due to unengaging
content that does not focus on individual learning types or are not designed to fit the
target audience's job roles [22], with user feedback rarely taken into consideration by
the implementing body. Initiatives such as the application of educational activities
within a SME to promote cyber awareness have been seen as the first step towards the
mitigation of threats against data and the operational aspects of a business [8]. Such
activities have been shown to remain in the participant's memory, influencing their
behaviours permanently [22]. This shows that a simple activity can be highly effective at
managing IS within a business and comes at a low-cost threshold compared to other
more advanced solutions that larger organisations would implement with their
extensive resources.

## Governance issues of IS Management in SMEs
The most established information security governance (ISG) frameworks currently
available, much like the respective SETA initiatives, are universal one-size-fits-all
approaches predominately designed for larger, resource-rich, organisations [23]
requiring dedicated departments to implement successfully. Due to the inherent
complexity of frameworks, and resource constraints that inhibit the ability to
successfully implement ISG in SMEs [24], business owners are unsure of where to even
begin to govern IS.

SMEs in Australia are lacking governance policies as 1 in 4 of them are still using
unsupported operating systems, running Windows 7 or earlier [2] and research showing
that SMEs will implement technologies to increase customer satisfaction without
considering the risks associated with the technology [5]. Larger organisations scrutinise
any technology through ISG policies and procedures to ensure its security before
implementing it into the business. Many SMEs lack top management support and
technical knowledge in comparison to larger organisations with dedicated teams
responsible for implementing governance policies such as cloud-based backups [26],
an ISG task crucial for limiting the extent of a cybersecurity incident.

Although there is not a single best framework to implement into a SME due to the
unique structures of SME environments [23], a SME can develop, implement, and
embed a strategy following a guideline more generically suited to their business
structure. Benz and Chatterjee developed a scalable cyber evaluation tool (CET) using
NISTs Cyber Security Framework (CSF), focusing on a smaller pool of NIST standards
(35 out of 96) that are more particular to SMEs, reducing the complexity associated with
the implementation of ISG [5]. The CET gives recommendations to improve a business's
cyber resilience following NIST CSFs to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover,
providing value ratings for each recommendation’s importance.

To successfully govern IS management in a SME, The Australian Institute of Company
Directors (AICD) suggests setting clear roles and responsibilities in the organisation.
This can be achieved by documenting who has a responsibility for cybersecurity and
appointing cyber champions within departments to promote cyber resilience [15]. Most
importantly, a SME needs to plan for a significant IS incident, having safeguards in
place, such as regular data backups, to prevent the downtime associated with cyber
incidents.

## Recommendations for further research
With the lack of available resources the biggest roadblock to the implementation and
governance of IS management frameworks, research should be applied to the
possibility of government grants to supplement the gap that SMEs face. Furthermore,
research should be applied to cost-efficient implementations of SETA and ISG programs
specifically tailored toward SMEs [13] that are scalable, and adaptable to a business’s
values, goals and objectives.

## Conclusion
With SMEs facing an inherent dependency towards adapting to digital-based solutions,
the need for sound IS management is critical to the longevity of a business. Cybercrime
is on the rise, and SMEs need to do their due diligence to protect themselves, their
reputation, their clients, and their business partnerships from the risks associated with
cybercrime, particularly from the human element within an organisation.

The main hurdle SMEs face is a lack of resources to sufficiently implement IS
management procedures. Frameworks for SETA and IS governance are also generally
one-size-fits-all solutions targeted for larger organisations, which leaves ambiguity
when it comes to implementing policies into a SME. Although not a perfect fit, NISTs
CSF provides an avenue for SMEs to analyse their cyber awareness, with researchers
emphasising narrowing the spectrum of the framework to tailor more towards SMEs.
This case study provided insight into the current landscape of IS management and
governance in SMEs, highlighting the risks associated with poor IS management, a
justification for the implementation of sufficient IS management, and the challenges
faced by SMEs when it comes to implementation and governance.

Further research needs to be applied to creating scalable and adaptable policies and
procedures to better suit the needs of SMEs. As SMEs take up 90% of the global
business landscape, governments should be looking towards creating grant programs to
supplement financial limitations faced by business owners.
